# Simple-Linear-Regression2
The code which I am providing is capable of learning and predicting the future results ! So for example , I am also providing data set in which I have already trained my model , this data set contains years of experience of a employee and their respective salary , our model will get trained from this data and it will be capable of predicting the salary of new employee which is going to do job in that company .

I have also uploaded video on youtube about this model . https://youtu.be/YPKhAVMKTEY
